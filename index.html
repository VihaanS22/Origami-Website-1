        <li><h4>Their humps let them store up to 80 pounds of fat which they can live off for weeks and even months!</h4></li>

         <h4>Chameleons become more active, social, and interested in breeding when exposed to UV rays.</h4>
        <h4> In addition to perceiving UV light, they're great judges of distance, because each eye has excellent depth perception.</h4>

            <li><h4>When they leave their burrow, sometimes cicadas will make chimneys of mud over the exit.</h4></li>

    <li><h4>They can find their way back to their nest from 1300 miles away.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>They could identify visual patterns and therefore tell them apart.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>They're more efficient multitaskers than people are.</h4></li>

        <h4>Bears can reach a weight of between 150 and 370 kilogrammes depending on age and season. </h4>
    <h4> In the wild, these omnivores spend up to 16 hours a day looking for food, which is reflected in the saying 'hungry as a bear'. </h4>
    <h4>Brown bears in the wild are mainly active at dusk and at night.</h4>
    <h4>Bears have a particularly good nose: their sense of smell enables them to sniff food at a distance of several kilometres.  </h4>
